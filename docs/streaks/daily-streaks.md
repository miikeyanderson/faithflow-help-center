# Daily Streaks

Build consistency and maintain your daily learning streak.

## What is a Streak?

A streak tracks consecutive days of app usage. Maintain your streak by completing at least one lesson or activity each day.

## Streak Requirements

To maintain your streak:
- Open the app daily
- Complete at least one lesson or activity
- Must complete before midnight in your timezone

## Streak Rewards

Building a streak earns you:
- Bonus XP for milestone days
- Special badges and achievements
- Motivation to stay consistent

## Streak Freeze

**Protect your streak:**
- Earn or purchase streak freezes
- Automatically protects your streak if you miss a day
- Limited quantity - use wisely

## Losing Your Streak

Your streak resets to 0 if you:
- Don't use the app for 24+ hours
- Miss a day without an active streak freeze

**Don't worry:**
- Start a new streak immediately
- Your total days of practice are still tracked
- Past achievements remain

## Tips for Maintaining Streaks

1. **Set daily reminders** - Enable notifications
2. **Practice at the same time** - Build a routine
3. **Start small** - Even 5 minutes counts
4. **Use streak freezes strategically** - Save for emergencies
5. **Track your progress** - Watch your streak grow
